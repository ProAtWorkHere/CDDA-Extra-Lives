	{ "u_message": "Welcome to Extra Lives, a mod that allows you to continue your journey when you would otherwise meet an untimely end.\n\nYou start with a number of extra lives depending on your difficulty choice, and dying consumes one of these extra lives. You have a maximum number of extra lives, which can be increased up to a cap by finding a very rare encounter.\n\nIn all difficulties above Tourist, you will passively regain extra lives over time.\n\nYou may discover Strange Stone Circles rarely in the wilderness, which have altars that can be examined to set your current position as a respawn location.", "popup": true },
	{ "u_message": "What happens when you die:\n\nNo matter what, upon death you will drop all of your items, be they carried, worn or wielded. Mutations, CBMs and other character-intrinsic properties are preserved.\n\nThere are 3 ways to respawn in Extra Lives, the choice of which is determined by the difficulty level. All 3 options will always fully heal you, remove negative conditions and effects, and bring your vital stats back fairly close to baseline. These 3 are:\n\n*   Here: You respawn right where you died. You gain 60 seconds of great speed, invisibility, fall damage immunity, waterbreathing and 30 seconds of incorporeality (immune to most things but you cannot interact with physical matter). You also emit waves of force for 5 seconds, continually knocking back nearby enemies.\n\n*   At Strange Stone Circle: Same effects as respawning Here, except you are only given this option if you have previously found and activated an altar in a Strange Stone Circle. Brings you back to that location.\n\n*   Randomly: A random location far away from your place of death in an unexplored region is selected and you are respawned there. You are granted 5 minutes of the regular respawn beneficial effects and a temporary metaphysical body suit that provides climate protection.", "popup": true },
	{ "u_message": "Tips:\n\n   * When you die, your corpse location is displayed in the Missions Menu, and can be viewed on the Map with the mission selected.\n\n   * You can craft a Respawn Info Tablet with a single rock while near a respawn altar. Activate it to display your current difficulty, number of extra lives, maximum extra lives, maximum extra lives cap, and if you have a SSC respawn point selected, the location of that respawn point (viewable in the Missions Menu).\n\n   * Respawn altars save your current location as a respawn point when you examine one. They are incredibly heavy, but not totally impossible to move...\n\n   * Strange pockets of unreality may rarely be found, containing an extremely valuable material. But beware, for within these pockets your movement is severely slowed and time passes much faster within...", "popup": true },
